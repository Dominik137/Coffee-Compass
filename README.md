# Coffee-Compass
Phase 1 project made by Dominik Arment and Emmi Lindsey at Flatiron School!

Coffee Compass is a website to helps users find coffee shops in the Denver area, and gives them useful information such as Wifi, space rating, location, and tells the 
user if they're open or not.

We also used two api's. One is to pull a funny coffee gif to display as soon as the page is loaded and display in the middle. 
The other one is from Google Maps and displays a map for each coffee shop when selected. Both APIs use an API key that we store in a secret file.
The Google API used a linked script from Google, while the giph api fetched from a link.

There are 5 coffee shops already stored in the DB.json, however, we added a submit feature to input all the info for any new coffee shops the user may find. 
All this information will post to the db.json and persist!
all the functionality will work too with any new coffee shop submitted, as long as the info is input correctly. 

We had a lot of fun styling the website too and used a grid layout for our CSS so the header stays in a nice spot at the top and the three columns each serve a useful 
purpose for the layout. The middle contains all the information about any shop, the left column has a nav bar of images of all the shops that are stored,
and the right contains the submit form for any new shops that want to be added !
